# Python

There are special use-cases that each language supports; this document pertains to **Python models**.

At the moment, Python models have no specific features.
However, there're two presets:
- `PYTHON_DEFAULT_PRESET` which is default and relies only on language features,
- `PYTHON_PYDANTIC_PRESET` which is using [pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/) data validation and settings management using Python type hints.\
You can find an example of its use [here](../../examples/generate-python-pydantic-models/index.ts)
